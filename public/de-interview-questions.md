I screwed up 3 interviews because I couldn't explain my projects properly.

Here is how you can explain your project in an interview.

When you’re in an interview, it’s important to know how to talk about your projects in a way that impresses the interviewer. Here are some key points to help you do just that:

➤ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄: Give a quick 30-second summary. What’s the project about?

➤ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: What problem did you solve? Why did it matter?

➤ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: What did you build? How did it solve the problem?

➤ 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗥𝗼𝗹𝗲: What exactly did you do? Any challenges you handled?

➤ 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 & 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀: Mention the tech stack. Keep it relevant.

➤ 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁: What changed because of your work? Share outcomes
.
➤ 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸: If it was a team project, how did you contribute?

➤ 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: What did you learn? What would you do differently?

hashtag#Protip: Remember, 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗸𝗲𝘆. And the best way to get better at it is to practice with mock interviews, get feedback from Senior Data Professionals and refine your answers until you can explain them confidently.
