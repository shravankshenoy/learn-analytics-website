## ML (Machine Learning) Fundamentals
- **Model** : Models are simplified representations/mathematical representation of real-world phenomena that enables explanations and can make predictions (it does so by identifying hidden patterns)
- **Features/Variables** : Input to model. 
- **Weight(parameters)** : Represent the strength or importance of different features or variables in a model's prediction process. It dictates how model behaves and what results it produces
- **Array** : Collection of numbers. Model weights are represented as array
- **Vector** : 1 dimensional array (has magnitude and direction)
- **Training** : The process of teaching a model to learn patterns and make predictions by exposing it to labeled data
- **Target Variable** : The variable the model aims to predict. For example if we want to predict the house price from size of the house, the house price is target variable
- **Independent variable** : The variables believed to influence/impact the target variable. For example if we want to predict the house price from size of the house, house size is an independent variable, as it impacts the house price.

## NLP (Natural Language Processing) Fundamentals

NLP is a machine learning technology that gives computers the ability to interpret, manipulate, and comprehend human language. Some important terminologies in this field are:

- **Structured** : Data follows structure i.e. organized in the form of row and columns
- **Unstructured** :  Data which does not follow a predefined structure eg. audio, video, text
- **Semi structured data** : Data which follows some structure, but not as rigid as structured data i.e. does not have the complete structure to fit into rows and columns eg. json, yaml, xml
- **Language model** : A machine learning model designed to understand human language
- **Token** : A basic unit of text (for a language model). Tokens can be whole words, parts of words, punctuation marks, or even individual characters
- **Tokenization** : The process of breaking down a large piece of text into smaller, more manageable units called tokens.  Visualize tokenization at https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst
- **Fine tuning** : A machine learning technique where an already trained model is further trained on a smaller, task-specific dataset to adapt it for a particular use case
- **Training vs Finetuning**: Training refers to building a model from scratch, while fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and adjusting some of the weights to suit a new task better
