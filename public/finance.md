* Not all financial instruments are securities, but all securities are financial instruments. Bank deposits (rd/fd), loans and insurance policies (life, health) are financial instruments but not securities (because bank deposits cannot be traded)

### Doubts
1. Why is account receivable a current asset?
2. Why Land Is Not a Current Asset?
A current asset is something that meets both of the following criteria:
    * It is expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually 1 year).
    * It is held primarily for trading, operating, or short-term liquidity purposes.
A land does not meet second criteria, because company does not expect to sell the land in the next 12 months under normal business operations.

3. Why are prepaid expenses an asset?
4. How does Cred have a good liquiditiy ratio?
