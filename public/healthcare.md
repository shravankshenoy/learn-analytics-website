* Major entities/parties in healthcare are
    * Providers/Facilities
    * Payers
    * Patients
    * Suppliers

* Provider : Any person that delivers health care services eg. physician, dentist, optometrist

* Facilities : Any organization that delivers health care services eg. hospital, clinic, nursing home, diagnostic centre (many a times provider and facilities are used interchangebly)

* Patient : Receives care

* Payers : Payers are the entities that finance or reimburse the cost of health services. They do not deliver care directly (unlike providers), but they cover the cost of care delivered to patients eg. insurance providers, medicare (federal program for people 65+ or with certain disabilities), medicaid (joint federal–state program for low-income individuals)

* Suppliers : Entities that furnish medical items or equipment. Major categories include
    * MedTech (provide machines like xray, mri, ecg, oxymeter, stent, hospital beds, oxygen tanks, prosthetics)
    * Biopharma 


* Personally Identifiable Information (PII) : Any data that can identify an individual

* Personal Health Information (PHI) : A subset of PII that includes health related information of individuals

* HIPAA stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Goal of HIPPA is
    * Protect patient information i.e PHI (Accountability) : HIPAA sets standards to secure sensitive patient data
    * Improve efficiency and lower admin costs (Portability) : HIPPA encourages the use of standardized electronic formats for healthcare transactions between providers, payers, and clearinghouses, which helps make the healthcare industry more efficient and can lower administrative costs. 

* 3 main rules of HIPPA
    * Security
    * Privacy
    * Breach notification rule

* HIPPA is a self assessment

* Key components of HIPAA-compliant payment processing
    * Data Encryption: All patient and payment information must be encrypted during transmission and when stored. 
    * Secure Storage: Patient data should be stored securely, with limited access. 
    * Access Controls: Strict user authentication and access management systems must be in place to ensure only authorized personnel can access the data. 
    * Audit Trails: Payment systems should log and monitor all activities to create a comprehensive audit trail. 
    * Business Associate Agreements (BAAs): If a third-party payment processor handles any HIPAA-covered functions, a BAA is necessary to formalize their role in protecting PHI and maintaining HIPAA compliance

* Remittance (in medical billing) : Refers to the payment from an insurance payer to a healthcare provider for submitted claims 

* Explanation of benefits (EOB) : A statement from health insurance company that explains the medical services you received, how much the services cost, what the insurance plan paid, and what you may owe

* Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) : Computer-to-computer exchange of business documents in a standard electronic format between business partners

* Electronic remittance advice (ERA) : A digital Explanation of Benefits (EOB) sent by a insurance payer to a healthcare provider, detailing claim payments and adjustments, including denials. It uses a standard Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) format, often the EDI 835, to automatically post payments, reduce manual keying errors, and provide efficient financial management for providers. 

* X12 HIPAA is the common name for the set of specifications businesses use to transmit healthcare transactions in the United States

* X12 EDI 835 : An Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA). The 835 is the specific transaction set within the HIPAA-compliant X12 standard for the electronic transmission of healthcare claim payment and remittance information. (It is an electronic transaction used in the healthcare industry to electronically send a Health Care Claim Payment/Advice from an insurance payer to a healthcare provider. It details how a payment was made and providing an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) by including information on paid, denied, or reduced claims, co-pays, and other adjustments) 

* HIPPA vs Non HIPPA payment : Health care claim payments from insurance companies or government payers to providers are HIPPA payment, whereas patient selfpay is example of Non HIPPA payment

* Types of products for healthcare payments
    * Claims Payment solution (CPS)
    * Patient Payment solution (PPS)
    * Supplier Payment solution (SPS)

* Claim : Healthcare claim is a formal request for payment submitted by a provider to a payer

* Claim Adjudication : Judgement on how much much of the claim amount to pay, deny or adjust

* Claims Payment Solution : Technology/system (often used by payers) to automate the processing, adjudication and payment of healthcare claims to providers/facilities. Common ones include
    * Waystar
    * Experian Health

* Patient Payment Solution : Technology platform/service that helps providers (e.g., hospitals, clinics) manage, collect and process payments directly from patients

* Supplier payment solution : Financial technology system or service that helps healthcare organizations (providers or payers) pay suppliers efficiently

* CPS vs Payment gateway : A claims payment solution is NOT a payment gateway like Stripe which just moves money. A claims payment solution adjudicates complex healthcare claims, applies benefit rules, and then moves money in a HIPAA-compliant and regulated way.

* Need for PPS : Even though payer provide money, patients are often responsible for 10–30% (or more) of their bill. (need not be HIPPA compliant)
